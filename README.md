# About the voluntier project
Deltax Hacks 2020 Hackathon Project VolunTier

This project was created for the Deltax Hacks 2020 Hackathon Project. The Hackathon website is this: https://deltaxhacks.com/
This project was made by Pranav Subbaraman, Raghav Misra, and Lehuy Hong. 
This project is an updated version of the voluntier project that was made in the Pleasanton Hackathon.
It uses Vue for styling. 

I worked on the front end and User Interface. I used Vue for styling in CSS and HTML. 
I designed and styled the Login Page, Sign Up Page, Landing Page, Account Settings Page, and Leaderboard Page.

The Hackathon was from September 26 - September 27.
